# Development workflow

The unit of work is a **change**: a feature, a modification, or a decision with design content, carried from proposal to record. These rules describe its life in three stages — `plan`, `build`, `ship` — and what holds throughout.

Work too small to be a change — a typo, a one-line correction with nothing to specify — skips `plan`. It does not skip `ship`: nothing reaches production except by merging.

These rules assume this project has a remote, pull requests, continuous integration, a deploy triggered by merging to the trunk, and OpenSpec for its change records, and that more than one session may work on it at once.

## Your branch and working tree

A change gets one branch and one working tree and keeps both from proposal to record. Cut the branch from the freshly fetched trunk; put the working tree at `.worktrees/<name>`.

_Claude Code binding:_ `EnterWorktree` places working trees under `.claude/worktrees/` and will not enter one elsewhere.

Several sessions may work on one change, one after another and never at the same time. A session resuming a change enters the working tree that change already has.

Fetch the trunk periodically throughout, and bring it into the branch rather than meeting it at the pull request. Before the branch is pushed, rebase onto it. After, merge it in: a rebase then needs a force push over a branch under review, where a merge does not.

**Provision before relying on any verification result.** A new working tree carries tracked files only: no ignored configuration, no installed dependencies, no build artifacts, no share of external state. **Verification that cannot reach what it needs skips and reports success rather than failing**, so an unprovisioned run is indistinguishable from a passing one. Until provisioning is complete, report verification as **not run, and why**.

Provisioning is complete when every step this project names has been reached, not the first. Reach that state rather than asking whether an earlier session already did; each step is safe to repeat.

**Where verification writes to a shared service, take your own namespace within it**, named deterministically from your working tree, and bring it to the project's initial state whether or not one already exists under that name. Check for the service before reporting it unavailable. Nothing here reclaims a namespace; they accumulate.

Where this project binds these two rules to a particular service, the binding is an adjacent section of this file; read it as part of them.

## Reporting where the change stands

On entering a working tree, before anything else, and again as the last thing said before stopping, report:

| change | stage | task progress | commits |

The entering report carries one further cell, the verification result.

Derive the report from the repository where you can — artifacts, commit log, forge. Where a fact is in neither, ask rather than assume it.

**The stage names a state, never an act.** The acts are the transitions between them, and the sections below walk them in order — some together, where one act follows another with no decision in between:

```
plan:   explore · draft · review · fix · approve · commit · derive tests
build:  apply · verify · review · fix
ship:   open pr · merge · deploy · confirm · archive
```

A state is `<family>:<transition>ing` while that transition runs and `<family>:<transition>ed` once it has happened — `plan:drafting`, `build:applying`, `plan:approved`, `ship:merged`. Two reorder: `plan:tests-derived` and `ship:pr-open`. Add `blocked:<what>` and `abandoned` at any point.

Always write the family prefix: `plan:reviewing` and `build:reviewing` dispatch different reviewers.

## plan

**explore** — a change with no proposal yet. Auxiliary artifacts such as a handoff may exist.

**draft** — use a specification-driven change process for non-trivial features, changes and significant architectural decisions. Do not begin implementing without a proposal recording what is intended and why. A change's artifacts are read before implementation, not written afterwards to describe what was done.

**review → fix → approve** — dispatch review against the complete artifact set, never a package still being written. Fix and re-review until the verdict permits proceeding, bounded at six rounds; on reaching it, report where the loop stands and what is outstanding, and ask before continuing. A conditional pass is permission conditional on the fixes it names: apply them and continue without a further round. Where the reviewer judges the concept unsound rather than the artifacts defective, stop and raise it immediately, whatever the count.

_Claude Code binding:_ dispatch `ai-toolkit:change-plan-reviewer` once every artifact the change calls for is complete. Do not use `/code-review` for this gate — it reads a diff, and at this point there is none. On `FIX REQUIRED` fix and re-dispatch; on `CONDITIONALLY APPROVED` apply the `[MINOR]` fixes and continue; on `APPROVED` continue; on `REJECTED` stop and raise it.

**commit** — suggest committing the approved plan before tests are derived from it; the tests map to that baseline.

**derive tests** — have an author other than whoever writes the implementation derive tests from the approved specification deltas, not from implementation code. That author needs this project's test command and test-path glob; both are in this project's own conventions.

A stated exemption applies where this project's rules name one for a class of change, and the reason is given when it is used. A change declaring no specification deltas owes no new tests, only that the suite stays green.

_Claude Code binding:_ dispatch `ai-toolkit:change-test-writer` after the verdict permitted proceeding, any conditions were applied and the plan was committed — and before implementing.

## build

**apply** — implement only once two things hold: a commit holding the approved plan, which follows the verdict that permitted proceeding, and the derived tests — or the stated exemption that excused them. Where either is absent, take the missing step rather than starting and noting the gap.

**verify** — run the verification relevant to the change: tests, type checking, linting, formatting, a build, whatever this project's conventions require. Do not report a change as complete without having run it.

**review → fix** — have an independent reviewer read the diff against the change's own specification: each requirement implemented, the implementation matching what the specification describes, the derived tests covering what changed, no unrelated scope, this project's conventions followed. This review reads code; the review in `plan` reads artifacts.

Dispatch against a diff that already passes verification. Re-review only where the fixes were substantial enough to warrant it, bounded at three rounds; past three, report where the loop stands and ask rather than dispatching a fourth. A review judging the implemented change unsound rather than defective exits immediately and is raised.

_Claude Code binding:_ run `ai-toolkit:change-code-reviewer` over the change's diff.

## ship

Nothing ships from a local machine. Never run the deploy command against production — a change reaches production by merging and by nothing else.

Every change reaches the trunk through pull requests, and takes at least two. Begin once verification passes on the branch head and `build`'s review has cleared.

**open pr → merge → deploy** — open the pull request, let continuous integration run, and wait for the operator's confirmation that it merged and that the deploy is healthy. Do not infer a merge, a deploy or a confirmed effect from a green pull request, an approval, or silence.

**confirm** — a healthy deploy is not the change working. Propose how the effect can be observed — what to look at, what provokes it, what result would mean it worked — and wait for the operator's confirmation.

Two classes cannot answer that gate and are waivable. Say so plainly, name the class, and wait for the operator to waive it; record the waiver in the change's own artifacts — the record is archived on the strength of it, and waiving your own gate is not the confirmation this step exists to obtain. Where a successor is intended, the waiver names its change-queue entry or the branch it was opened on:

- a change with no observable effect — a refactor, a dependency bump, an internal cleanup;
- a change that was the wrong change: its observation was made, its effect is absent, and it is not to be corrected in place.

A recorded waiver completes **confirm**: `ship:confirmed` is true of a waived change.

**archive** — once the effect is confirmed or the gate waived, bring the branch back to the freshly fetched trunk, commit the change's specification record there, and open a pull request for it: the last of the change's pull requests. The branch's commits are on the trunk by now, so this discards nothing and needs no force push.

Two is a floor. Where the deploy is unhealthy, or the effect is absent through a defect, fix it and re-enter at `build`'s review gate; the fix takes a pull request of its own.

**then remove the branch and the working tree** — once the record has reached the trunk through its own pull request, every other pull request the change opened has merged, and nothing uncommitted or unpushed remains. **Read a merge from the pull request's state, not from branch ancestry** — a squash or rebase merge leaves no ancestry to read.

An abandonment recorded in the change's own artifacts, stating that the change is abandoned and its work not wanted, replaces both merge conditions and the unpushed one, but not the uncommitted one. Commit the record before reading the gate.

Remove the branch locally and on the remote, and the working tree from the repository's main working tree rather than from inside the tree being removed. Nothing here removes the namespace.

## Throughout

**Commits.** Prefer small, focused commits over large ones bundling unrelated concerns. After a meaningful milestone, proactively suggest a commit rather than waiting to be asked. Before committing: look at the diff, run the verification relevant to what changed, and check that no secret or unintended file is included. Suggest the commit; do not make it without confirmation.

While applying, the derived tests fail by design until the implementation is complete, so the verification above cannot pass and a hook running it blocks the commit. Commit with `--no-verify`, and read that failure as expected rather than as a defect. It suspends the pre-commit check, not the gate: `verify` still runs before any completion claim.

**Scope.** Prefer changes small enough to review in one sitting; where one grows to cover multiple independent concerns, consider splitting it. Implement only what belongs to the change in progress — an improvement noticed along the way becomes a separate proposed change rather than being folded in.

**A second change surfacing.** Record it before doing anything else about it.

- Where the change in progress **depends** on it: record the dependency and the wait in the current change's own artifacts, then at most open the identified change and recommend it be continued in a separate session.
- Where it **does not**: record it in `docs/change-queue.md`, creating that file if absent, or open the identified change.

*Opening* one means a branch of its own and a `handoff.md` at its root, with no proposal — why the change was identified, what bears on it, and what it must not undo. The session that takes it up writes the proposal. Propose committing that branch at once; where the commit is declined, say that the handoff is unsaved.

Such a branch is created and left: it takes no working tree and does not become the branch this session works on.

`docs/change-queue.md` holds identified changes, deleted when archived; an entry there is the separate proposed change the scope rule calls for, recorded rather than opened. `docs/deferred-work.md` holds what this project has deliberately not done, deleted when it stops being true.

**Assumptions.** Do not silently invent a requirement that was not stated and cannot reasonably be inferred; where an important decision cannot be inferred, ask rather than guess. Record significant decisions in this project's own artifacts rather than in conversation history alone.

**The repository is the source of truth.** Do not rely on earlier conversation context for information the repository itself can supply. Prefer reading a file, a spec or a commit over recalling what a previous exchange said about it.
